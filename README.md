# Introduction

Appetizer is a learning project where I implemented my own API using Google Sheets via Google Apps Script. 
Scraped data from Kaggle for food items and converted it to an API using Google Apps Script.
The app allows users to place orders, which are then stored in a real-time Firebase database. 
I used SwiftUI for the frontend, focusing on learning API creation, pagination, Firebase SDK integration, Swift UI development, and UI/UX design principles.



# Features

1. Custom API: Built a custom API using Google Sheets and Google Apps Script.
2. Real-time Database: Stored user orders in a Firebase Realtime Database for efficient data management.
3. Pagination: Implemented pagination to handle large datasets and improve app performance.
4. SwiftUI: Utilized SwiftUI for creating a modern and responsive user interface.
5. Firebase SDK: Integrated Firebase SDK for authentication, real-time database updates, and analytics.
6. UI/UX Design: Focused on creating a user-friendly interface with attention to design principles.
