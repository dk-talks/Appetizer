# Introduction

Appetizer is a learning project where I built a complete food ordering system. Initially, I created an API using Google Sheets and Google Apps Script, scraping food item data from Kaggle. The project has since evolved to use a custom backend built with Java Spring Boot and a PostgreSQL database for improved scalability and performance. Users can browse food items, place orders, and all order data is stored in real-time using Firebase. On the frontend, I used SwiftUI, focusing on integrating APIs, implementing pagination, connecting with Firebase SDK, and applying solid UI/UX design principles throughout the app.



# Features

1. Custom API: Built a custom API using Google Sheets and Google Apps Script.
2. Real-time Database: Stored user orders in a Firebase Realtime Database for efficient data management.
3. Pagination: Implemented pagination to handle large datasets and improve app performance.
4. SwiftUI: Utilized SwiftUI for creating a modern and responsive user interface.
5. Firebase SDK: Integrated Firebase SDK for authentication, real-time database updates, and analytics.
6. UI/UX Design: Focused on creating a user-friendly interface with attention to design principles.
